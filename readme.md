##Steps

conda create -n condaeup_flask_ml python=3.6.1
source activate condaeup_flask_ml

##Requiremerents file
numpy

tensorflow
cv2
	conda install --yes --file requirements.txt

iterate over all lines in the requirements.txt file.

	while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements.txt

If a requirement is missing, then use:

    pip install firefly-python
    pip install opencv-python

If conda fails, we can also use pip:

	pip install -r requirements.txt


To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

a. For Mac:

    $ export FLASK_APP=webapp.py
    $ flask run
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

b. For Win:
    set FLASK_APP=webapp.py
    $ flask run
